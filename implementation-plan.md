### High-Level Components and User Interactions

For Backend Development:
- https://stack.convex.dev/convex-mcp-server
- https://docs.vectara.com/docs

1. **Open-WebUI**:
   - **Frontend**: Provides the user interface for interacting with the application, including the chat interface and custom workflows.
   -Backend Integration**: Handles the integration with other components, such as the custom server and LiteLLM proxy server.
   - **Extensibility**: Allows for the addition of custom logic and workflows, making it adaptable to specific organizational needs.

2. **Langfuse**:
   - **Observability**: Monitors and traces interactions within the application to ensure performance and reliability.
   - **Tracing**: Provides detailed insights into the flow of requests and responses, aiding in debugging and optimization.

3. **LiteLLM**:
   - **Proxy Server**: Acts as an intermediary between the frontend and backend services, managing requests and responses efficiently.
   - **Load Balancing**: Distributes incoming traffic evenly across backend servers to ensure optimal performance.

4. **Custom Server**:
   - **Complex Agentic Workflows**: Handles intricate logic and workflows that are specific to the organization's needs.
   - **Compatibility**: Seamlessly integrates with Open-WebUI, ensuring smooth communication and data exchange.

### Deployment Strategy with Kubernetes

To deploy the application as a Kubernetes cluster, follow these steps:

1. **Cluster Provisioning**:
   - **Infrastructure Setup**: Use a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) or on-premise servers to set up the Kubernetes cluster.
   - **Cluster Management Tools**: Utilize tools like `kubectl`, `kubeadm`, or managed Kubernetes services (e.g., EKS, GKE, AKS) for cluster management.

2. **Container Deployment**:
   - **Pods**: Deploy each component (Open-WebUI, Langfuse, LiteLLM, Custom Server) as separate pods within the cluster.
   - **Service Configuration**: Create Kubernetes services to expose each component, ensuring they can communicate with each other.

3. **Persistent Storage**:
   - **Volumes**: Use persistent volumes (PVs) and persistent volume claims (PVCs) for data storage, especially for Langfuse and the custom server.
   - **Storage Classes**: Define storage classes based on performance and availability requirements.

4. **Networking**:
   - **Ingress Controller**: Set up an ingress controller to manage external access to the application, routing traffic to the appropriate services.
   - **Network Policies**: Implement network policies to secure communication between pods.

5. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - **Prometheus**: Deploy Prometheus for monitoring cluster and application metrics.
   - **Grafana**: Use Grafana for visualizing metrics and creating dashboards.
   - **ELK Stack**: Set up the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack for centralized logging.

6. **Scaling and Load Balancing**:
   - **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**: Configure HPA to automatically scale pods based on CPU or memory usage.
   - **Load Balancers**: Use cloud provider load balancers or Kubernetes services with type `LoadBalancer` to distribute traffic.

7. **Security**:
   - **RBAC**: Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage permissions within the cluster.
   - **Secrets**: Use Kubernetes secrets to manage sensitive information such as API keys and credentials.

8. **Continuous Deployment**:
   - **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or ArgoCD to automate the deployment process.
